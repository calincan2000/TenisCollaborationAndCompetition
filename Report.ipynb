    "Similar to single-agent Actor Critic architecture, each agent has it’s own actor and critic network. The actor network takes in the current state of agent and output a recommended action for that agent. However the critic part is slightly different from ordinary single-agent DDPG. Here the critic network of each agent has full visibility on the environment. It not only takes in the observation and action of that particular agent, but also observations and actions of all other agents as well. Critic network has much higher visibility on what is happening while actor network can only access to the observation information of the respective agent. The output of the critic network is, nevertheless, still the Q value estimated given a full observation input(all agents) and a full action input(all agents). The output of the actor network is a recommended action for that particular agent.\n",
